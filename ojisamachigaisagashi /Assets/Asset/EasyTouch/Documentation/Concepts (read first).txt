Easy Touch V1.0: Concepts
=========================

The concept is very simple, EasyTouch uses the SendMessage method to notify you of an action on the touch screen or with mouse.

It send these messages on gameobject carrying the script, or on the selected object. A final option allows you to notify
a other gameobject.

EasyTouch allows automatic detection of all gameobjects with a collider with  the layer 8 (you can change the default layer as needed)

 
EasyTouch simulates the second finger when you press the ALT or CTRL key, an orange circle appears on the screen to 
the simulated position. 
ALT => For twist or pinch gesture
CTRL => For swipe or drag gesture

You don't need prefab ! You can easily manage every gestures with a simple script
